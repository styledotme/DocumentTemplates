## 3. Component Hierarchy

### Component Tree

Sure, here's an example of a component tree for the Makeup Cosmetics Inventory Management Dashboard:

```
App
├── Login
└── Dashboard
    ├── ProductTable
    │   └── ProductRow
    └── ProductForm
        ├── FormInput
        ├── FormTextarea
        ├── FormSelect
        └── FormButton
``` 

- `App` is the top-level component that renders either the `Login` or `Dashboard` component based on whether the user is authenticated or not.
- `Login` is the component that renders the login form.
- `Dashboard` is the main component that renders the `ProductTable` and `ProductForm` components.
- `ProductTable` is a table that displays the existing product inventory as `ProductRow` components.
- `ProductRow` is a row in the `ProductTable` that displays the details of a single product.
- `ProductForm` is a form for uploading new products and editing existing products. It contains multiple `FormInput`, `FormTextarea`, `FormSelect`, and `FormButton` components for the user to enter and submit product details.

- Dashboard: The main dashboard page.
- ProductTable: A table displaying the existing product inventory.
- ProductForm: A form for uploading new products and editing existing products.
- SearchBar: A feature to search for and filter existing products.

The data flow diagram shows the flow of data between the user, the dashboard, and the product data. 

- The user requests product data from the dashboard, which is sent to the server.
- The server returns the product data to the dashboard, which is displayed in the product table.
- The user logs in to the dashboard, and the server authenticates the user.
- The user uploads a product form, which is validated by the server and saved to the product data.
- The server sends a confirmation message to the dashboard.
- The user requests to edit a product, and the server returns the edit form.
- The user updates a product form, which is validated by the server and saved to the product data.
- The server sends a confirmation message to the dashboard.

### Data Models

- User: Represents a user of the application.
- Product: Represents a cosmetic product, including the name, description, price, and image.
